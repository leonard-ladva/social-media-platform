### Start Program
in /backend
```bash
go run *.go
```
in /client
```bash
yarn run serve
```

### Note
If you open real-time-forum folder currently in VS Code then, go modules appear to be broken, because we have 2 go.mod files, one in /backend and one in /test-forum. If you instead open /backend as a working directory folder then the error wont show.
